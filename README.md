# DesktopNotepadApplicationCPlusPlusAndQt
Developed a full-featured desktop Notepad application using C++ and the Qt Creator framework. Implemented core functionalities including text editing, file saving/loading, and a complete graphical user interface. This project strengthened my understanding of UI/UX design principles, event handling, and cross-platform desktop development.
